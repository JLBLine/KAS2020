    "Hi all, in this extra notebook, I'll go over the way I like to approach plotting, and some of the tricks I have picked up over the years. There are multiple ways to plot things, so this will be based on my experiences. We're going to try to do everything with just `matplotlib` for now. Be aware however, there are wrapper packages out there, for example packages like [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/#) that can make pretty plots, and `pandas` (which we will look at in the next notebook) which is great for doing an analysis and plotting a data set.\n",

    "In matplotlib, there are often two different commands that do essentially the same thing. This can be confusing at the start, and will just take practice and time to get used to. I'll try and point some of them out in the comments in the code to give you fair warning.\n",
