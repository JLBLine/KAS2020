    "`git` saves things locally on your computer, so if your laptop explodes, all your fancy code is gone forever. This is where an online code-hosting platform like `github` comes in (you can get started with `github` and [read all about it here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart). Each project you work on in `git` is called a 'repository' (repo for short). Once you have an account, any changes you 'commit' to your code locally on your machine can 'pushed' to github. This means you upload your code to the `github` servers, which save it for you, backing up your code. Beyond that, you can share you code with others, who can 'clone' your data off of `github`, and even make changes and push them to your code collaboratively. There are other code-hosting platforms, but I use `github`, so I'm teaching you what I know. As you progress in your career, do some research and choose which platform suits you best.\n",
