    "In this notebook, we'll go over the basics of Fourier Transforms and how you can achieve them using `numpy`. We'll go from 1D transforms to 2D transforms, look at how these transformations naturally happen in a lens/dish telescope, and how we can use them to form images from an interferometer.\n",

    "## Basics of Fourier Transforms\n",
    "Fourier transforms can be tricky to get your head around, and can be defined with a number of different normalisations. For that reason, I'm going to have to cover a chunk of theory here for it to make sense to you if you are new to them. So bear with me, and let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "A fourier transform (FT) is a way of decomposing a time varying signal into a number of sinusoidal waves that when combined, approximate the original time varying signal. The mathematical definition of the FT, $F(a)$, of the function $f(x)$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "F(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\exp(-2 \\pi i ax) dx\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of the variable $a$ are always the inverse of $x$. So if you have a time-varying function, say $f(t)$ with $t$ in seconds, you end up with $F(\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is a frequency with units s$^{-1}$. Hence how applying the Fourier transform to a time-varying signal gives us back the frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aight, enough talk, let's code. `numpy` has a numerical implementation (and so an approximation to the integral form) of the FT in `numpy.fft` (check out documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html)). The most simple example possible is to fourier transform a single sine wave. First off, let's make a sine wave:"
