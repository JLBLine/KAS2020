    "> Wait, what's up with `with`? In many other computer languages, memory is handled explicitly as part of the syntax. This is one of the notoiously difficult things in a lanugauge like `C` to get correct. `python` is lovely because is essentially does it all for you, talking to the computer automagically saying things like _\"this is a float, and it lives here, it needs this much memory\"_ etc. Unfortunately, this also means you never really know what it's doing half the time. So when opening something potentially large or complicated like a FITS file, using the `with` command here says _\"OK `python`, do your magic and open up this FITS file, and assign some parts of it to an array called `data`. Once we pop out of the indented whitespace below `with`, however, clean up after yourself, closing the `hdus` object and freeing all the memory associated with that.\"_ This is a nice, clean way of ensuring you don't have things hanging around in buffer that you don't need.\n",

    "OK, so there's a large of information. HDU means Header Data Unit, which is the highest level component of the FITS file structure. You can have multiple HDUs in a single FITS file - in this example we only have one. Most important here is the 'Dimensions' Column, which shows `(512, 512, 1, 1)`. This means we have data of that shape, so a 4-dimensional data set. Often FITS files come with multiple frequency slices, so even though we are going to plot a 2D image, there a 4 Dimensions to the data. So what shape is our data?"
