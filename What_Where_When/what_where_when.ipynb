    "# What, where, when?\n",
    "Knowing where and when to point your telescope is an important part of astronomy. As interesting sources rise and set at different times around the Earth, having an understanding of astronomical coordinate systems is important, especially when submitting observing proposals. In this notebook we'll go over the basics, and look at how you can make these kind of calculations in `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Right Ascension and Declination\n",
    "First and foremost, we measure the position of an astronomical object in Right Ascension (RA, or $\\alpha$) and Declination (Dec, or $\\delta$). This co-ordinate system is based around the rotation of the Earth; the North Celestial Pole is defined along the rotational axis of the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere ($\\alpha = 0^\\circ, \\delta=90^\\circ$), and the Celestial Equator $\\delta=0$ is defined by the Earth's equator. Essentially, we have just projected latitude and longitude onto a disant 'Celestial Sphere'. This is depicted in the following image that I got from this web address [here](https://voyages.sdss.org/preflight/locating-objects/ra-dec/) (all credit to the authors).\n",
    "\n",
    "![pre-flight-celestial-sphere.jpg](pre-flight-celestial-sphere.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth rotates within this 'Celestial Sphere', so although most sources have an (almost) constant position in RA and Dec, when you stare directly up from the Earth, RA is constantly drifting overhead, and changing with time. This is why RA is often measured in hours, minutes, and seconds. As there are $360^\\circ$ in a circle, and the Earth takes (almost) 24 hours to rotate, $1h = 15^\\circ$, which minutes being 1/60th of an hour, and seconds being 1/60th of a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is _not_ to be confused with degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds, which are often used to descibe Dec. An arcminute is 1/60th of a degree, and an arcsecond 1/60th of an arcminute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's expand on this using some code. We'll be using the `astropy.coordinates` module for this. There is plenty of documentation on all the fun things you can do with `astropy` coords, some of it [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/).

Remember to use `HDU.info()` when you open the FITS file to find out the dimensions of the data. This is an image of just the galacic plane in gamma-rays (cool) so the image is wide but short. To see some detail, only plot the x axis from pixel 3000 to pixel 5000. Do that by setting the x limits using matplotlib like this `plt.xlim(3000,5000)`. Also, use `vmin=0` and `vmax=6e-13` in your `imshow` command. Things you can see include Supernova remnants and Pulsar wind nebulae."

We need one last piece of the puzzle, `astropy.coordinates.AltAz`, which we can use in conjuction with our `EarthLocation` and `Time`, to see when galaxy is visible. Let's check out when the [Large Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud), which is located at RA, Dec = 05h23m34.5s, -69d45m22s, is visible to the LST:"
